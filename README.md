# [Project: Points to Profile](https://github.com/Dignatis/Points_to_Profile)
With this project task was to quantify change in the river bed over the years. 
Input data for this project was surveyed data from different  years (2004, 2014, 2016, 2018  and 2020). 
Surveyed data was in the form of points with X,Y,Z coordinates.

Task was thru different steps, here are quick summary of each (for more detailed explanation look in jupiter nootebook file): 

## Step 1

In this step all points data was projected on profile line.

## Step 2

Was to change from global coordinate system (X,Y,Z) to local, profile coordinate system (Xprofile, Z)

## Step 3

Was to determine referent plane and to find crossing points between  reference plane i profile (Xprofile, Z).

## Step 4

To find the area beneath the reference plane and profile for each year. 

## Step 5

To calculate and visualize changes.
